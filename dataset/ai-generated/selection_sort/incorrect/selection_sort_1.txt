In this implementation, the mistakes are intentional and include:

- Instead of finding the minimum element, we're finding the maximum element in the unsorted array.
- Instead of swapping the minimum element with the first element, we're swapping the maximum element with the last element.
- We're always swapping the maximum element with the last element, even if the maximum element is already at the end of the array.

These mistakes will cause the algorithm to sort the array in descending order instead of ascending order, and may 
lead to incorrect results or an infinite loop if the maximum element is already at the end of the array.
