The following program should ask the user for their age and name, then print a message based on their age. The first message should be "Hello, NAME! You are AGE years old!". If the person is below 18 years old, it should then print "You're underage!". If they are older than 66, it should print "You're old!". Otherwise, it should print "You are an adult.". It should also print out how many years left they have until retirement (or how many years they have been retired respectively), given a retirement age of 66. Is this correctly implemented?
